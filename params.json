{"name":"Xobotos","tagline":"XobotOS - Android ported to C#","body":"XobotOS project\r\n===============\r\n\r\nXobotOS is a Xamarin research project that explored porting Android\r\n4.0 from Java/Dalvik to C# to explore the performance and memory\r\nfootprint benefits of C#.\r\n\r\nXobotOS is a semi-automated port of the Android 4.0 source code from\r\nJava to C#.  The automated parts were ported using an improved version\r\nof Sharpen that can compile more advanced Java constructs and supports\r\ngenerics.  Most of the manual bits of code fall in two categories (a)\r\ncode to integrate with the host operating system and (b) replace the\r\nJava JNI code used to call into C, with the ECMA CLI P/Invoke\r\nfunctionality.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe various components of XobotOS are licensed under the same license\r\nas their upstream providers.  The C# versions of Android is licensed\r\nunder the terms of the Apache 2 license, while the improved version of\r\nSharpen is licensed under the GPL.\r\n\r\nXobotOS Source Code\r\n===================\r\n\r\nXobotOS is made up of the following sources:\r\n\r\n   sharpen:\r\n\r\n\t* Our updated version of Sharpen, see below for changes.\r\n\r\n   android/generated:\r\n\r\n\t* Fully translated Java to C# code, classes that have been\r\n\t  translated in this way contain the attribute [Sharpen.Sharpened]\r\n\r\n\t* Empty C# stubs based on the Java declaration: these are\r\n          needed as intermediate steps to get things to build in the\r\n          new C# world.  Classes with empty stubs are decorated with\r\n          the [Sharpen.NakedStub] attribute\r\n\r\n    android/extra-sources:\r\n\r\n\t* Custom written code that either fine tunes the port,\r\n          provides an alternative optimized version to a class or\r\n          provides a runtime facility.\r\n\r\n    android/api:\r\n\r\n\t* XML files that describe the translation process from Java to C#.\r\n\r\n    android/upstream:\r\n\r\n\t* Google's Android 4.0 source code.\r\n\r\n    libxobotos:\r\n\r\n\t* Glue code to integrate with various Android C++ libraries as\r\n          well as the Linux X11 host that sets up the toplevel window\r\n          and the optional OpenGL context.\r\n\r\n\t* Mostly calls into Skia, Jpeg, OpenGL and ICU libraries.\r\n\r\n    binaries:\r\n\r\n\t* Libraries to get you started without requiring you to build Skia,\r\n\t  and other native Android tools.\r\n\r\n\t* Screenshots, videos, and some basic precompiled samples.\r\n\r\n    monodevelop:\r\n\r\n        * Add-in to build native XobotOS applications with MonoDevelop\r\n\r\n    samples:\r\n\r\n\t* Ported samples to C# using XobotOS\r\n\r\n    external:\r\n\r\n\t* Native libraries needed to build the unmanaged libxobotos C library\r\n\r\nSharpen\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this project is a vastly improved Sharpen tool that is\r\nable to port very sophisticated and advanced Java codebases from Java\r\nto C#.   This code lives in the \"sharpen\" directory.\r\n\r\nThis modified version of Sharpen can cope with the following enhancements:\r\n\r\n\t* Java generics\r\n\r\n\t* XML-driven translation process\r\n\r\n\t* Type remapping for native Java types to C# types, and supports\r\n\t  for custom type mappings.\r\n\r\n\t* Support for translating code that does native interop\r\n\r\n\t* Support for generating C's .c and .h files for native glue\r\n          (to assist in P/Invoke support)\r\n\r\n\t* Add attribute-supported translations\r\n\r\n\t* Improved incremental compilation\r\n\r\nDocumentation on the improved Sharpen engine will be posted in the\r\nfuture so other developers can more easily port Java code to C#.\r\n\r\nSupport \r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis code is provided as-is, and we do not offer support for any bits\r\nof code here, nor does Xamarin plan on continuing evolving XobotOS at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
